## Explaination

Therer are two files in here [inervention.r](inervention.r) and [matrius_final.r](matrius_final.r). 

matrius_final.r is the file that contains the projections, processing and plotting of the three matrixes.
intervention.r is a projection of a test matriix where we see what would happen with our proposed interventions.
